# Herosquad
Hero Squad is an application that allows users who interact with it to create heroes and squads that contain a particular number of heroes such as killing squad or intelligence squad. Heroes can be affiliated with only 1 squad at a single time, therefore if the hero was to switch to another group, their name should not be present in the previous squad that they were in.
